# Parallelising Red deer algorithm (RDA) for solving Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

#### In this project, I have used MPI for parallelising Red deer algorithm (RDA) for solving Travelling salesman problem (TSP). RDA is a meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by the unique mating process of scottish red deers.
